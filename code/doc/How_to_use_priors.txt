We use priors for the parameters that are not sufficiently sampled during the observations, like ingress and egress times. You can also use priors instead of fixing parameters.

(For example, use priors when ingress and egress values are poorly constrained in a MCMC run, which affects the midpoint and width values. We also use them when data have very low S/N to avoid fixing midpoints, or widths, if they also shift a lot with each MCMC run.)

To use priors you need to have a prior knowledge for them, meaning values from the relevant literature or from MCMC runs from our collaborators. 

Procedure for using priors is as follows:
 
In your ancil directory in  params.py, you have this section:

    #Priors
    p.priorvars  = ['width', 't12']            #List of variables with priors, applies to each model
    p.priorvals  = np.array(([[0.00467, 0.00057, 0.00057],[0.005399, 0.000226, 0.000226]]))  
                                              #Include [mode, lower sigma, upper sigma] to describe
                                              #each asymmetric Gaussian prior


# priorvars is the parameter you want a prior for, and its name is taken from the planet_name-initial.txt file from your ANCIL directory.
# priorvals has 3 values: mode, uncertanty low, and uncertanty high
                        mode - is the value from the tep file, or MCMC run from the collaborators that you expect to have in your model
                        uncertainty low - is the negative value, lower value of the uncertainty if they are not Gaussian symmetric (you do not need to put minus, or plus)
                        uncertainty high - is the positive value, higher value of the uncertainty if they are not Gaussian symmetric


You can use as many priors as you want. The example shows how to use two priors at the same time.

You need to put the step-size under that prior in the ANCIL/planet_name-initial.txt file as usual, which will be two to three magnitudes smaller.  Also, you will put the expected value of that parameter in the first row as an initial value from which MCMC will start.

t12 prior
#########

Particularly for the t12 prior. you will put prior only on t12, and then equate t12=t34 by using step size = -4

Example:

midpt     	width     	depth     	t12       	t34       	flux
4.8805e-01	5.6020e-02	1.9917e-03	5.3999e-03	5.3999e-03	2.4588e+04
4.5000e-01	1.0000e-03	0.0000e+00	1.0000e-03	1.0000e-03	0.0000e+00
5.7000e-01	1.0000e+00	1.0000e-01	8.0000e-02	8.0000e-02	1.0000e+06
1.5000e-04	2.0000e-04	4.0000e-05	1.0000e-04	-4.0000e+00	1.5000e+00


In the first row, put the value of your t12 from the literature, or collaborators' MCMC run, so that MCMC starts from that expected value. In the t34 also put that value, but be careful to put -4 into the step size row.


If your SDNR value is changing when you use a prior, it is because ingress and egress values are different from the theoretical value. That is not a problem. If they do not change, that is because the fitted ingress and egress values with a prior are very close or exactly like the theoretical (paper value).

BEWARE!!! 
When you do orthogonalization, the number of parameters changes!
You have one more parameter at the beginning.
So if you want to do ORTHO with prior and you have ingres = egress, then you have to put -5 in the stepsize for egress.
