---- HOW TO EDIT A POET CONTROL FILE----

This file is analogous to the old runfiles.


But the structure is somewhat different. Values are separated by
spaces, in the form:
  parameter value1 value2 ... valueN

The format also allows comments using #


The Event Control File: (eventname.pcf)
---------------------------------------

When you start a new event, you will need to edit the values of the
event control file (eventname.pcf), here we will review the parameters
in that file:


-planetname: Enter the name of the planet, e.g.:
  planetname WASP 18b
  planetname TrES 1b


-planet: enter the event name according to the naming convention (see
/home/esp01/doc/spitzer_events), e.g:
  planet  tr001b


-ecltype:  enter the eclipse type: s for secondary, p for primary. o for orbit.


-photchan: enter photometry channel, 1 through 4 for IRAC, 5 for IRS,
or 6 for MIPS.


-visit: enter the visit number of the Spitzer event.


-tepfile: the name of the tepfile.  Go into the tepfiles
directory (/home/esp01/runs/seclsn/data/ or /home/esp01/obsprep/TEP/)
and search for the most recent tepfile for this planet, e.g.:
  tepfile /home/esp01/runs/seclsn/data/TrES-1-2009-01-26-01.tep


-datadir: the directory where the data are located.  Go to the data
directory (/home/esp01/data) and find the data for your event.  Note
that these may be named like events but often have capital letters or
combine channels (WA012bs131), e.g.:
datadir data/2005-Spitzer-phot/TR001bs51/


-sscver: The pipeline version. Type ls in the datadir to see the
pipeline versions, and select the most recent pipeline version, e.g.:
  sscver S18.7.0


-aorname: The AOR key numbers of the observations. Type ls in the
pipeline version directory to see the available AORs. There are two
different types of AOR: regular AORs and calibration AORs.  Enter
the key numbers for the AORs in the order they were shot (which might
not be numerical order (without the leading 'r').  If there are two
channels shot simultaneously (e.g., IRAC 1+3), each AOR will have data
from both channels.  E.g.:
  aorname 14913024


-aortype: the type of AOR, 0 for regular, 1 for precalibration, and
2 for postcalibration. Enter the values in the order corresponding
to the aorname order, e.g.:
  aortype 0

Important!: don't include calibration AORs, only put data AORs.


-pmaskfile: In the aor dir, type ls.  You will see some channel
directories.  For IRAC, choose the channel number that corresponds to
the Spitzer bandpass in the spitzer_events file (1 through 4).  For
IRS it will be channel 0 and for MIPS it will be channel 1.  cd into
this directory. There are four subdirectories in this directory: bcd,
cal, pbcd, raw. Look in the calibration (cal) directory.  There should be a
file with a .fits extension with pmask in the name.  E.g.:
  pmaskfile sep07_ch4_pmask.fits


-kuruczfile: The Kurucz file can be found in
/home/esp01/ancil/kurucz/.  Look for the file name that begins with
the name of your planet. Enter this file name in the kuruczfile
field.  e.g.:
  kuruczfile tres1-fp00k0odfnew.pck 


-psffile: Only if you are using IRS or MIPS you can specify a
PSF file.  Otherwise leave it as it is.  Look in the calibration
directory. Search for a file with PRF or PSF in the name, and put the
full location of the file:
  psffile /home/esp01/data/2005-Spitzer-phot/TR001bs51/S18.7.0/r14913024/ch0/cal/b0_prf_blue.fits


-npos: star positions on chip. Usually 1 for IRAC, 4 for IRS. you will
be able to check and fix this number after runing event.py, e.g:
  npos 4

-nnod: number of telescope motions per cycle. Setting it to npos has
work so far (but for MIPS see chart in control file), e.g.: 
  nnod 4

See table in eventname.pcf to set npos and nnod.

That's all for the event control file, you can ignore the rest of the
parameters.



Centering Control File: (center.pcf)
------------------------------------

FINDME: how are fgc and fgp different?
-method: select  centering method to use, from  fgc, col, lag or lac.
  fgc: Fit Gauss function.
  col: Center of light fitting.
  lag: Least asymmetry Gaussian.
  lac: Least asymmetry col.
  fgp: Fit a Gauss profile (using a least squares routine, slower).

-noctr: if True, don't center each frame.

-ctrim: trim the array to a box with radius ctrim, centered in the target.
-psfctrim: same as centrim, but for the psf image.

-cradius:  window used in least asymmetry calculation.
-csize:    radius of box where least asymmetry will look for the solution.

-psfcrad:  same as cradius for PSF aperture correction.
-psfcsize: same as csize for PSF aperture correction.


Photometry Control File: (photom.pcf)
-----------------------

-photap:  photometry aperture of the star.

-skyin:   inner radius of the sky annulus.

-skyout:  outer radius of the sky annulus.

-skyfrac: minimum fraction of annulus pixels to be good and on frame
 to avoid a bad frame flag.

-skymed:  use median rather than mean in sky level estimation.

-verbose: print in the terminal photometry results as it's being processed.

-apscale: rescaling (integer) factor by which to expand the data using
 2D, bilinear interpolations.  Example: If apscale=5, each pixel becomes a
 5x5 block of pixels.

-psfexpand: Same as apscale, but for the PSF image.

-dooptimal: If True do optimal photometry, using a psf created from the data.

-from_aper: The name of a previuos run photomdir, to import the (x, y,
 aplev, skylev) values from.

-psf: The location of a PSF image to use in optimal photometry.

-oresize: For optimal photometry, the supersampled factor of the PSF
 image. (i.e. if 100 pixels of the PSF are equivalent to 1 data pixel
 then oresize is 100).

-otrim: The radius of a trimmed box around the target. Must be
 consistent with the size of the PSF image. (i.e. if the PSF has shape
 2100 x 2100, and oresize=100, means the data image shoud have size 21
 x 21, the radius (otrim) is then 10, since 2 x otrim + 1 =21).
